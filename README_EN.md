## Development Guide

> This project uses **STS2-RitsuLib**'s attribute-driven auto-registration. On startup, `Main.cs` calls
`ModTypeDiscoveryHub.RegisterModAssembly` to scan the entire assembly. All types annotated with `[RegisterCard]`,
`[RegisterRelic]`, `[RegisterOwnedCardKeyword]`, etc. are registered automatically — **no** manual content manifest file
> is required.

|------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `Cards/{Rarity}/XxxCard.cs`   | Create a card class inheriting `WineFoxCard`, add `[RegisterCard(typeof(WineFoxCardPool))]` |
| 2    | `Const.cs`                    | Add `CardXxx = Root + "/cards/card_xxx.png"` to `Paths`                                     |
| 3    | `STS2_WineFox/cards/`         | Place the card image `card_xxx.png`                                                         |

| 6    | `Character/WineFox.cs`        | To include in the starting deck, add to `StartingDeckTypes` (**Basic cards only**)          |

> **Token cards**: use `[RegisterCard(typeof(WineFoxTokenCardPool))]` and add `showInCardLibrary: false, autoAdd: false`
> to the constructor. No other registration steps needed.

## Localization Notes

### Card Description Dynamic Variables

| Format             | Effect                                                                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{VarName}`        | Shows the variable's current value (static)                                        |
| `{VarName:diff()}` | Shows the current value; highlights the diff when upgraded or buffed (recommended) |

| Location                                            | Supports Dynamic Variables |
|-----------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------:|
| `cards.json` description (bound to `CanonicalVars`) |             ✅              |
| `card_keywords.json` keyword tooltip                |             ❌              |
| `powers.json` → `description`                       |             ❌              |
| `powers.json` → `smartDescription`                  |    ✅ (`{Amount}` only)     |

### Common DynamicVar Types

| Class                              | Description Variable | Usage         |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| `DamageVar(value, ValueProp.Move)` | `{Damage:diff()}`    | Attack damage |
| `BlockVar(value, ValueProp.Move)`  | `{Block:diff()}`     | Block         |
| `PowerVar<T>("Name", value)`       | `{Name:diff()}`      | Power stacks  |
| `new("Name", value)`               | `{Name:diff()}`      | Custom value  |
| `CardsVar(value)`                  | `{Cards:diff()}`     | Cards drawn   |
| `EnergyVar(value)`                 | `{Energy:diff()}`    | Cost / Energy |
